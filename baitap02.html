        In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it
        is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web
        browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break
        onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and
        underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are
        seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the
        browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically
        readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the
        page.
